            <p><b>Feeding time isn’t just about filling a bowl</b>—it’s about <b>fueling your furry friend for a happy, healthy life</b>! Make sure their meals match their age, size, and energy level, and go for foods that list real meat or fish on the label (no weird fillers or rainbow-colored bits, please). Trusted brands like Royal Canin, Hill's Science Diet, and Purina Pro Plan are vet-approved and pet-loved. Got a sensitive snacker? Your vet can help you find the perfect recipe for pets with allergies or tummy troubles. Not sure how much chow to serve? Check out online feeding guide calculators where you can input details of your pet for a personalized portion guide. And don’t forget the basics: fresh water every day and treats in moderation (we know, those eyes are persuasive!). Stick to a regular feeding routine to keep digestion smooth and mealtimes stress-free.</p>

        <h2>Grooming & Hygiene</h2>
        <img src="images/grooming-icon.png" alt="Dog and cat smiling while getting brushed" title="Grooming & Hygiene" class="section-image"/>
        <p>Keeping your <b>pet fresh and fabulous</b> isn’t just about <i>looking cute</i>—it’s a big part of <b>staying healthy</b>! A good brushing session helps keep shedding under control, untangles those pesky mats, and gives their coat that show-stopping shine. Baths? Only when needed, and always with gentle, pet-friendly shampoo (no bubblegum-scented mystery soap, <i>please</i>). And don’t skip the little things: nail trims, ear cleanings, and brushing those pearly whites can save you from bigger vet visits later. Best of all, grooming time is bonding time! Toss in some treats, give lots of praise, and turn it into a spa day your pet actually looks forward to.</p>

        <h2>Exercise & Enrichment</h2>
        <img src="images/exercise-icon.png" alt="Dog and cat smiling with their toys" title="Exercise & Enrichment" class="section-image"/>
        <p>Pets are <b>happiest when they’re on the move</b>! Movement isn’t just a burst of energy—it’s their way of exploring the world, expressing joy, and bonding with their favorite humans. Dogs go wild for walks, games of fetch, and anything that lets them show off their zoomies. A romp through the park, a splash in a kiddie pool, or a sniff-filled stroll around the neighborhood can turn an ordinary day into a tail-wagging celebration. Cats? They’re all about climbing, chasing feather wands, and sneaking into mysterious corners. Give them a cardboard box, a dangling string, or a high perch, and they’ll turn into acrobats with a mission. Whether it’s a backyard adventure or a living room play session, <b>keeping your pet active and entertained is the secret to a happy, healthy life</b>.</p>
