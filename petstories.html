            <div class="pet-info">
            <p><b>Coco is a spirited 9-year-old Jack Russell Terrier mix with a personality as bouncy as his favorite ball</b>. His eyes light up the moment he spots it, and he’ll chase it with the enthusiasm of a puppy, zigzagging across the yard like a furry rocket. Fetch isn’t just a game to Coco—it’s a lifestyle. When he’s not sprinting after toys, he’s sniffing out snacks with the precision of a gourmet detective, always hoping for a treat or two (or five). Though he’s full of love, Coco’s got a sassy streak—he’ll side-eye you if you’re late with dinner and has been known to “talk back” with dramatic little grumbles. Despite his diva moments, he’s endlessly loyal and knows how to melt hearts with a single tail wag. <b>Coco’s charm is irresistible</b>, and <i>life with him is never short of entertaining</i>.</p>

            <div class="pet-info">
                <p><b>Momo is a 1-year-old feline queen who rules the household with a velvet paw and a whole lot of attitude</b>. She’s the sassiest of them all, waiting like a regal princess for her meals to be served—preferably on time and with flair. Her gaze alone can command attention, and she’s not afraid to meow her mind if things aren’t up to royal standards. Despite her diva demeanor, <b>Momo’s cuteness is absolutely disarming</b>—one look at her big eyes and soft whiskers, and you’ll forgive just about anything. She struts through the house like it’s her personal runway, tail high and confidence higher. Snuggles are rare but magical, and when she chooses you, it feels like winning the lottery. Momo is a tiny tornado of charm and sass, and life with her is a fabulous feline adventure.</p>

            <div class="pet-info">
                <p><b>Lobo is a 2-year-old German Shepherd with a personality that’s equal parts whirlwind and zen master</b>. He’s got energy for days, zooming around the yard like a furry tornado—until he suddenly transforms into a snoring puddle of fluff on the couch. His favorite pastime? Playing with <i>rocks</i>. Ever since he discovered that rocks don’t break under his enthusiastic chomping, they’ve become his go-to toy and his ultimate match. One minute he’s launching into a game of fetch with a boulder-sized grin, and the next he’s flat-out snoozing, recharging for his next round of chaos. Lobo’s vibe is weirdly perfect—a lovable mix of wild and chill that keeps everyone guessing. He’s a one-dog show, and <b>life with him is a delightful rollercoaster of tail wags and nap breaks</b>.</p>
